## Introduction

[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) is a progressive JavaScript framework that is built on top of Vue.js. It simplifies the development of universal or single-page Vue applications by providing a powerful and flexible framework.

## Features

### 1. Universal Mode

Nuxt.js supports server-side rendering (SSR) out of the box. This allows your Vue.js applications to be rendered on the server, providing better performance and SEO benefits.

### 2. Convention over Configuration

Nuxt.js follows the principle of convention over configuration. It comes with sensible defaults and allows you to configure your application based on conventions, reducing the need for extensive configuration.

### 3. Automatic Code Splitting

Nuxt.js automatically performs code splitting, meaning that it generates optimized bundles for each page of your application. This ensures that users only download the JavaScript code necessary for the pages they visit.

### 4. Vue Ecosystem Integration

As Nuxt.js is built on Vue.js, it seamlessly integrates with the Vue ecosystem. This includes Vuex for state management, Vue Router for routing, and other Vue plugins.

### 5. Plugin System

Nuxt.js provides a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend and enhance your application easily. Whether it's integrating third-party libraries or adding custom functionality, plugins make it straightforward.
