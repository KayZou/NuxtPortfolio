# React.js Overview

## Introduction

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React simplifies the process of creating interactive and dynamic UIs.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Declarative Syntax

React uses a declarative syntax, making it easy to understand and visualize how the UI should look based on the current application state.

### 2. Components

The building blocks of React applications are components. Components encapsulate logic and UI, promoting reusability and maintainability.

### 3. Virtual DOM

React utilizes a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance. Changes are first made to the virtual DOM, and then only the necessary updates are applied to the actual DOM.

### 4. JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows you to write UI elements in a syntax that resembles the final output.

## Getting Started

To start building with React, follow these steps:

1. Create a new React app using Create React App:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-react-app
